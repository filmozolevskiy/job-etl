# Integration Tests Status

## ✅ COMPLETED: Integration Tests Disabled for Safety

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: All integration tests are safely disabled

## Summary

All integration tests in `tests/integration/` have been converted to placeholders and are automatically skipped. This prevents accidental data deletion from development databases.

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. `tests/integration/test_normalizer_integration.py` - Replaced with placeholder
2. `tests/integration/test_jsearch_integration.py` - Replaced with placeholder  
3. `tests/integration/test_example_integration.py` - Added skip decorators
4. `docs/testing-setup.md` - Updated with current status and re-enablement instructions
5. `docs/integration-tests-status.md` - This file (status summary)

### Test Results:
```bash
# Integration tests (all safely skipped):
$ pytest tests/integration/ -v
5 skipped - ✅ SAFE

# Unit tests (all passing):
$ pytest tests/unit/ -v  
68 passed - ✅ WORKING
```

## Current Test Strategy

| Test Type | Status | Command | Database Required |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Unit Tests | ✅ Active | `pytest tests/unit/ -v` | No |
| Integration Tests | ⏸️ Disabled | `pytest tests/integration/ -v` | Yes (when enabled) |

## Why This Was Done

**Original Problem**: Integration tests would delete all data from:
- `raw.job_postings_raw` (normalizer tests - deletes ALL rows)
- `staging.job_postings_stg` (normalizer tests - deletes ALL rows)
- Test source data (jsearch tests - deletes matching rows)

**Risk**: Running these tests against a development database could destroy real data.

**Solution**: Disable integration tests until a dedicated test database is configured.

## How to Re-Enable (When Ready)

### Step 1: Create Test Database
```bash
# Create database
createdb job_etl_test

# Run schema
psql -d job_etl_test -f db/schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Restore Original Tests
```bash
# View git history
git log --oneline tests/integration/

# Find commit before tests were disabled (look for this change)
git show <commit-hash>:tests/integration/test_normalizer_integration.py > tests/integration/test_normalizer_integration.py
git show <commit-hash>:tests/integration/test_jsearch_integration.py > tests/integration/test_jsearch_integration.py
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://job_etl_user:job_etl_pass@localhost:5432/job_etl_test"

# Linux/Mac
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://job_etl_user:job_etl_pass@localhost:5432/job_etl_test"
```

### Step 4: Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

## Testing Best Practices Going Forward

1. ✅ **Always use a separate test database** for integration tests
2. ✅ **Run unit tests frequently** - they're fast and safe
3. ✅ **Set DATABASE_URL explicitly** before integration tests
4. ⚠️ **Never run integration tests** against production or shared dev databases
5. ✅ **Keep test data minimal** for faster test execution

## Documentation References

- Detailed setup guide: `docs/testing-setup.md`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_normalizer.py`
- Test fixtures: `tests/conftest.py`

## Placeholder Test Content

Each integration test file now contains:
- Clear warning about why tests are disabled
- List of tests that should be implemented
- Instructions for re-enabling
- Reference to setup documentation

Example:
```python
@pytest.mark.skip(reason="Integration tests disabled - requires dedicated test database")
def test_normalizer_integration_placeholder():
    """
    Placeholder explaining what tests go here and how to enable them.
    """
    pass
```

## Next Steps

When you're ready to work with integration tests:

1. Read `docs/testing-setup.md`
2. Set up dedicated test database
3. Restore tests from git history
4. Configure DATABASE_URL
5. Remove `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators
6. Run `pytest tests/integration/ -v`

Until then, continue using unit tests for safe, fast testing without database dependencies.
