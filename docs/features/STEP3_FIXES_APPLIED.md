# Step 3 Implementation - Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Reference:** STEP3_REVIEW.md

## Summary

This document tracks the fixes applied based on the code review of Step 3 - Bootstrap Postgres Locally.

---

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Port Conflict Between pgAdmin and Airflow Webserver
**Issue:** Both services attempting to use port 8080 on the host

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed pgAdmin port from `8080:80` to `8081:80`
- Airflow webserver remains on port `8080:8080`
- Updated README.md with port mappings

**Files Modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml:38`
- `README.md`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

### 2. Missing POSTGRES_PASSWORD in airflow-init
**Issue:** airflow-init service couldn't access the database password from Docker secrets

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `postgres_password` secret to airflow-init service
- Modified connection command to read from secret file: `$(cat /run/secrets/postgres_password)`
- Properly escaped the command in YAML

**Files Modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml:213-237`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Minor Issues Fixed ✅

### 3. Redundant Index on Primary Key
**Issue:** `idx_staging_job_postings_hash_key` index redundant because `hash_key` is already a PRIMARY KEY

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed redundant index creation
- Added comment explaining that PRIMARY KEY already creates an index

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/bootstrap_db.sql:61`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

### 4. Sample Data in Production Script
**Issue:** Test data would be inserted in all environments including production

**Fix Applied:**
- Commented out the sample data INSERT statement
- Added clear note about development-only usage
- Suggested using separate seed file for test data

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/bootstrap_db.sql:147-152`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Security Improvements ✅

### 5. Weak Password Examples
**Issue:** Documentation showed weak, predictable passwords

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated README to use `openssl rand -base64 32` for generating passwords
- Removed weak password examples
- Added instructions for setting file permissions (chmod 600)

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

### 6. Key Generation Documentation
**Issue:** No documentation for generating Airflow Fernet and secret keys

**Fix Applied:**
- Added "Generating Keys" section to README
- Included commands for generating Fernet key using Python
- Included command for generating secret key using OpenSSL
- Added instructions to add keys to .env file

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md`

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Documentation Improvements ✅

### 7. Port Mappings Section
**Addition:** Added clear documentation of all port mappings

**Files Modified:**
- `README.md` - Added "Port Mappings" section

**Status:** ✅ ADDED

---

## Issues Deferred (Not Critical for Step 3)

### 8. Weak Airflow Admin Password
**Issue:** Hardcoded "admin" password in airflow-init

**Reason for Deferral:** 
- Step 3 focus is PostgreSQL bootstrap
- Airflow setup is actually Step 4's scope
- Can be addressed when properly implementing Step 4

**Recommendation:** Fix when implementing Step 4 - Bring up Airflow

**Priority:** MEDIUM (for Step 4)

---

### 9. Database Backup/Restore Documentation
**Issue:** No documented recovery process for volumes

**Reason for Deferral:**
- Out of scope for initial bootstrap
- Better addressed in operational documentation phase

**Recommendation:** Add to Phase 1 or Phase 2 documentation

**Priority:** LOW

---

### 10. Comprehensive Testing Suite
**Issue:** Manual testing only, no automated tests

**Reason for Deferral:**
- Phase 0 focus is on getting infrastructure running
- Automated testing is planned for later phases
- Manual verification confirms functionality

**Recommendation:** Add to CI/CD implementation tasks

**Priority:** MEDIUM (for Phase 1)

---

## Testing After Fixes

All fixes have been applied to the codebase. To verify:

### Test 1: Port Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify no port conflicts
docker-compose ps

# pgAdmin should be on port 8081
# Airflow webserver should be on port 8080
```

**Expected Result:** All services start without port binding errors

---

### Test 2: PostgreSQL Bootstrap
```bash
# Start just postgres
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Check schemas exist
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U job_etl_user -d job_etl -c "\dn"

# Should show: raw, staging, marts, public
```

**Expected Result:** All schemas created successfully

---

### Test 3: Database Connection from Airflow
```bash
# Start postgres and airflow-init
docker-compose up postgres airflow-init

# Check logs for successful connection
docker-compose logs airflow-init | grep "postgres_default"

# Should show successful connection creation
```

**Expected Result:** Airflow connection created without password errors

---

### Test 4: No Sample Data in Production
```bash
# For a FRESH database installation:
# First, remove any existing volumes
docker-compose down -v

# Start postgres
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Check raw table (should be empty)
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U job_etl_user -d job_etl -c "SELECT * FROM raw.job_postings_raw;"

# Should be empty (0 rows)
```

**Expected Result:** No sample data inserted on fresh installations

**Note:** If you see 1 row, it's from a previous test run before the fix. Remove volumes and recreate to verify the fix.
